                    <h4 style="font-size: 15px;">Mr.EEEEE Thank you for teaching me AE for the past three years. It's hard to believe that graduation is already here🥹. In your class, I didn't just learn English i think lol I learned how to think more deeply about the world.Through Model UN and our discussions about global issues, you helped me see things from a much wider perspective.
                        <br><br>I'm especially grateful that you introduced me to TUJ and even took the time to visit the uni with me. That meant more to me than I can explain. You didn't just support me as a student you truly cared about my future.Out of all the teachers I've met, you are honestly the kindest teacher . I feel really lucky that I got to spend these three years learning from you.
                        <br><br>Thank you for everything, Mr. E. I'II never forget what you taught me as I can……
                        <br><br>Love uuuuuuuuuuu
                        <br><br>Wait I know you always work so hardddddd😡sometimes even too hard. Please don't push yourself too much and make sure to take care of your health💞

                        <br><br>In Active English class, your lessons always sparked my curiosity, especially when you talked about historical events. Your experiences also surprised me and made the lessons even more interesting.
                        <br><br>During my preparation for the university entrance exam, your support was extremely helpful. Without your guidance, I might not have passed the interview test at Gakushuin University. Even though you were busy with work, you still took the time to help me practice for the interview many times using different questions. Thanks to you, I was able to gain confidence in my English interview.
                        <br><br>Honestly, I wish I could continue learning with you. Through these three years, I have been able to improve many of my skills through your lessons.
